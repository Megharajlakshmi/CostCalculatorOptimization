# CloudServiceCalculator

There are 3 different sections to calculate total spending on cloud service

Section A :- 2 to 3 different inputs would be there
Section B :- 2 to 3 different inputs would be there
Section C :- It can be of 2 types (external & internal)
             If external there is a special price section called CSP
             If CSP is 0 or none, then browser would open a new window with a url
             Then user can add the value in CSP
             If internal, it is same as section A & B, multiple values would be there
Final output would be summation of all sections which are summation of values under them
